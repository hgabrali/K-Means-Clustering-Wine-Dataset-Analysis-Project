## K-Means Clustering: Wine Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a complete, step-by-step implementation of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm applied to the well-known **Wine Dataset** from scikit-learn.

This project serves as a practical exercise demonstrating key stages of a clustering workflow:

* **Data Preparation:** Loading and inspecting the dataset.
* **Feature Scaling:** Implementing `StandardScaler` to normalize features for distance-based analysis.
* **Optimal K Determination:** Utilizing the **Elbow Method** to find the most appropriate number of clusters ($K$).
* **Model Training & Prediction:** Fitting the `KMeans` model and assigning cluster labels.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing cluster quality using metrics like the **Silhouette Score**.
* **Visualization:** Creating insightful scatter plots to visualize the resulting clusters across key features.

This exercise provides a clear, documented example of unsupervised learning for data segmentation and pattern recognition.
